## Input Group
Only one example provided see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/input-group/ for more details.
See [shared](layout/shared) for additional parameters    

### Example with `BS` Class Helper
`Value="@("X")"` is so the demo has a type and compile with adding code blocks. You will want to use `@bind-Value="YourRealVar""`
